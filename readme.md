# Roman Numeral Converter

### Overview

This project is a simple Java-based service to convert integers to Roman numerals using Spring Boot. Roman numerals are widely used for numbering systems, and this project adheres to the traditional Roman numeral representation (e.g., Wikipedia: Roman numerals).

Roman numerals are defined by the following symbols:

* I = 1
* V = 5
* X = 10
* L = 50
* C = 100
* D = 500
* M = 1000

This service converts integers between 1 and 3999 to their equivalent Roman numeral representation.
